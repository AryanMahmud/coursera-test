		<h2 class="text-center"> The First Paragraph</h2>
		<p>This section, as we all know, needs to take up a lot of space, and I mean A LOT. Since I refuse to use lorem ipsum text or simply blah blah blah for the entire text, my section is going to be filled with actual sensical sentences. Though this will not be any meaningfull paragraph for you it will be for me. That is because I refuse to use the cringy text fillers. Though this may also count as useless text filler, it's still thousands of times better than the other meaningless ones. This specific moduel assaignment is honestly perplexing to me, because I never used twitter bootstrap and never though of using it either. Sure, it can be said that this is way easier because everything is predefined by experts and all I have to do is insert the classes and focous completely on the HTML, but thats the thing... I don't know the name of the classes yet causing me to contineously go to the bootstrap and find a class that meets my requirements, apply it and get fustrated when it doesen't work the way I want it to. Also there is the fear of the page misbehaving at a certain width or hight, or due to some thing I could not conceive of. It's worrying. Until I put in the effort, or am forced to put in the effort to get to know bootstrap, its classes and how to use them efficeintly, I would much rather stick to my own css files. My own coded styles. Atleast then I'll be at ease knowing what exactly will happen at each width and hight, knowing its limits and exactly what it is.  You see, if I was told to make this without bootstrap I would be done two days ago, but alas - twitter bootstrap has been draining the life out of me, making me wonder why things aren't lining up. I kiterally spent atleast an hour trying yo figure out whats wrong. Well I may be bickering a lot but I also must say that bootstrap... is actually a very diverse and useful tool. I may not be able to use it, but if I did - it would be an arsenal. It's THAT usefull. Also I hope that I'll get the hang of it and start using it in time. Ok now I've completely run out of things to say so I'll be restating the first three instructions of this assaignment now. </p>
		<p>The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop and tablet (same), mobile, and mobile with mobile menu dropdown shown. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.</p>
		<p>Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into a css folder under the solution container folder, e.g., module3-solution/css.</p>
		<p>For this assignment, you are to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible. I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. If you've cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be in the examples/Lecture25 folder. Copy the contents of examples/Lecture25 to your solution container folder (e.g., module3-solution) as a starting point.</p>

		 <p>"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"</p>
          <p>BY ROBERT FROST </p>
          <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.   
           His house is in the village though;   
           He will not see me stopping here   
           To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>
           <p>My little horse must think it queer   
           To stop without a farmhouse near   
           Between the woods and frozen lake   
           The darkest evening of the year.</p>
           <p>He gives his harness bells a shake   
           To ask if there is some mistake.   
           The only other sound’s the sweep   
           Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
           <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
           But I have promises to keep,   
           And miles to go before I sleep,   
           And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
